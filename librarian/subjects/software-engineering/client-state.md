# client-state

First touch: [[2026-08-22-4]] — the 2026-08-22 harvest wave. Class: EXTENDS.

## State

6 -> 9 techniques, 2 -> 3 applications. Merged from FOUR independent scout proposals across four territories. One additive forward-pointer was added to an existing technique so the new write-path technique and the existing read-path guard do not read as rival owners.

## Open leads (banked, with return conditions)

- **the safe default is the failure you can see** (proposed law, not added). FIVE independent recurrences claimed, two of them in EXISTING techniques of this same subject (`persistence-and-migration`, `invalidation-strategy`). Tied with guard-failure-is-not-consent as the wave's best-evidenced proposal.

## Declines

- No application was written for `optimistic-write-path`. The source tree's entire optimistic-write API — mutex, compare-and-swap predicate, rollback — has zero call sites; the repo's own harness notes say so. Excellent material for a technique, but an application is a claim that a real stack realizes it in production, and unwired code is not that. The one place it is cited says plainly that it is unreferenced.

## 2026-08-29 — /deepen architecture batch (dry_streak 0)

10 techniques, 6→8 applications (rust--persistence-and-migration from personas — first
second stack; react--invalidation-strategy from systedo-case; ascent Tree B on
async-race-guards). Landed: replicated-record named as its own species (owned by
sync-replication); debounce/throttle excluded from the race-guard family; "invalidation
reaches readers, not only entries"; persistence version-skew split by payload class with
the older-build-never-writes-back invariant; paint-time revalidation cancel as
mitigation. Survived counter-evidence: per-entity mutation mutex, conditional revert,
derive-not-store, store-topology claims (atomic model = alternative realization, not
refutation). Banked: rust--status-fsms application from personas background_job.rs
(return: next round or when personas bumps the status vocabulary); retained-old-version
migration fixture (return: personas CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION bump). Techniques near
saturation; next yield expected from fleet deviations, not survey.
