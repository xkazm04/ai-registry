## Skill Reflection

After the work, record only useful observations supported by this run. No lesson is
a valid result. Reflection inherits the task's authorization; it grants no additional
permission to edit another repository, send data, commit, or publish.

**Run log.** Unlike a lesson, this is written on every run that started work - failed and
aborted runs included; skip read-only info modes and runs cancelled before any work. Append
ONE line to `.ai/skill-runs.local.jsonl` at the root of the checkout you worked in: local,
gitignored run output inside the task's own repository, never a write into the registry.
The registry pulls it later (`/librarian skills` on the same machine). When a registry
checkout is reachable (`registry.local` in `.ai/manifest.yaml`), prefer its writer, which
stamps project, device and version for you:

```sh
node <registry>/scripts/log-run.mjs --skill {{name}} --outcome <o> --difficulty <1-5> \
  --provider <claude|openai|xai|qwen|google|other> --model <your model id> [--effort <level>] \
  [--tokens-est <n>] --result "<one sentence>" --comment "<self-reflection>"
```

Otherwise write the line yourself: `{"ts":"<ISO, UTC Z>","skill":"{{name}}","outcome":…,
"difficulty":…,"provider":…,"model":…,"effort":…|null,"tokensEst":…|null,"result":…,"comment":…}`.

- `outcome`: `shipped` (the goal landed) / `partial` / `no-op` (ran correctly, nothing to
  do) / `parked` (designed or staged, deliberately not landed) / `failed` / `aborted`.
- `difficulty` rates the task as this run met it: 1 trivial - mechanical; 2 routine - the
  method as written; 3 demanding - real judgment calls or one detour; 4 hard - dead ends,
  rework or an operator course-correction; 5 at the edge - partial or failed on the merits.
- `model`/`effort` as your harness states them (`null` effort when you cannot see it).
  `tokensEst` is the drop in the harness's remaining-token counter since this skill was
  invoked, or `null`; exact figures are measured later from transcripts - never guess one.
- `result` is one line (max 240 chars). `comment` (max 2000) is the self-reflection a
  reviewer reads: what worked, what the method made harder, where its instructions were
  wrong, missing or ignored. No filesystem paths or email addresses.
- Never read run logs during a run. They are evidence ABOUT this skill for its reviewer;
  an executor that reads its own diagnosis contaminates the next measurement.

**Project learning.** Only when this run produced an observation that would change how a
future run behaves. A run that went as the method describes writes nothing: an entry that
restates the procedure, records "no issues", or repeats the task is a defect, not a
deliverable. When there is such an observation and local edits are within scope, put one
dated line in the overlay this skill's `## Project overlay` section names, under
`## Skill improvement log`. **Write only into an overlay that already exists.** If the
project has none, put the observation in the response instead - creating a new tracked
file for a reflection is scope the task did not ask for, and a reader who never asked for
the skill has to review it. If the overlay is a structured config (YAML, TOML, JSON),
record the note as comments so the file keeps parsing, or use the response.
Use a supplied memory contract only when its destination and writes are authorized.
Keep project details out of the shared method.

**Method learning.** Identify the installation before editing anything. A local
`.ai/registry-installation.local.json` receipt can identify development versus release,
the registry revision, and selected skill versions. Verify any link's actual target;
do not assume a skill directory is a writable registry link.

- For a pinned release, marketplace cache, ordinary copy, or unknown installation,
  keep a proposal in the project overlay or response. Do not edit the installed method
  or silently relink it. Adoption and rollback are explicit installation operations.
- For a development link, edit the registry only when that checkout is already within
  the accepted task scope. Otherwise report a proposal. Authorized changes belong in
  the source checkout, followed by its gates; commit only when the task authorizes it.
- Record an actual lesson in `LESSONS.md` against the version **used**:
  `## <version-used> - <YYYY-MM-DD> - <project-name>` and concise bullets. A proposal
  must be labeled as such; structural checks are not evidence of field effectiveness.
- Applied skill changes require a version bump: patch for wording, minor for a step
  refinement, major for method redesign. A lesson alone needs no bump. Shared stamped
  clauses are edited in the registry's `docs/skill-clauses/` and regenerated with
  `scripts/apply-skill-clauses.mjs`, never patched in individual installed skills.

**Domain learning.** Follow `## Knowledge sync` when present, within the same scope
and privacy boundaries. A method lesson and a domain knowledge lead are different
artifacts; do not fabricate either to fill a reflection quota.
