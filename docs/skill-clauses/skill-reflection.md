## Skill Reflection

After the work, record only useful observations supported by this run. No lesson is
a valid result. Reflection inherits the task's authorization; it grants no additional
permission to edit another repository, send data, commit, or publish.

**Project learning.** Put a dated observation in the consuming project's configured
overlay under `## Skill improvement log`, when local edits are within scope. Use the
location in this skill's `## Project overlay` section. If none is configured, use
`.agents/{{name}}/config.md` for Codex or `.claude/{{name}}/config.md` for Claude.
If the harness is unknown, propose the note in the response instead of guessing a path.
Use a supplied memory contract only when its destination and writes are authorized.
Keep project details out of the shared method.

**Method learning.** Identify the installation before editing anything. A local
`.ai/registry-installation.local.json` receipt can identify development versus release,
the registry revision, and selected skill versions. Verify any link's actual target;
do not assume a skill directory is a writable registry link.

- For a pinned release, marketplace cache, ordinary copy, or unknown installation,
  keep a proposal in the project overlay or response. Do not edit the installed method
  or silently relink it. Adoption and rollback are explicit installation operations.
- For a development link, edit the registry only when that checkout is already within
  the accepted task scope. Otherwise report a proposal. Authorized changes belong in
  the source checkout, followed by its gates; commit only when the task authorizes it.
- Record an actual lesson in `LESSONS.md` against the version **used**:
  `## <version-used> - <YYYY-MM-DD> - <project-name>` and concise bullets. A proposal
  must be labeled as such; structural checks are not evidence of field effectiveness.
- Applied skill changes require a version bump: patch for wording, minor for a step
  refinement, major for method redesign. A lesson alone needs no bump. Shared stamped
  clauses are edited in the registry's `docs/skill-clauses/` and regenerated with
  `scripts/apply-skill-clauses.mjs`, never patched in individual installed skills.

**Domain learning.** Follow `## Knowledge sync` when present, within the same scope
and privacy boundaries. A method lesson and a domain knowledge lead are different
artifacts; do not fabricate either to fill a reflection quota.
