# `--challenge` - the proving-ground strategy

Read from `SKILL.md` § "Challenge mode". This file is the long form: the cohort
rule, the two challenge lenses, the card, the critic, the deck gate, the build
waves, the integration step and the scorecard.

The other three strategies are tuned to land SAFE work: S and M, measured, routed
by evidence, with every L parked for a human. That tuning is right for a standing
quality loop and wrong for one specific question: **how good is this model (or
this builder setup) at the hard half of the job** - seeing the structural move a
context needs, arguing it from the tree, and then landing a multi-file, risky
change without breaking anything. `--challenge` asks that question on purpose. It
is the moonshot shape (see LESSONS 2.8.0, four runs) turned into a method: fewer
ideas, bigger ones, each one built, and the run scored.

## 1. What a challenge candidate is

| Field | Floor | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| size | **M or L** - never S | an S is not a challenge; it is the stabilize loop's job |
| effort | **>= 5** (1-10) | multi-file, a real design decision inside it |
| impact | **>= 7** | a user or an operator notices, or a whole class of defect closes |
| risk | **4-8** | moderate to high. Under 4 it belongs to `--stabilize`/`--develop`. Over 8 is an irreversible-grade change and is never built here |
| write set | **<= ~15 files, <= ~800 changed lines**, declared up front | one builder, one wave. Bigger is **XL**: a staged plan, backlogged as `architecture` |

A card below any floor is not rejected - it is **re-homed**: written to the
ordinary backlog under the strategy it belongs to, and the slot is re-scouted.

## 2. Cohort - which contexts get challenged

The loop picks ONE context; a challenge run picks a **cohort** (default 6,
`--cohort N`, or `--one <context>`, or `--group <name>` for one group's contexts).
`scripts/coverage.mjs --challenge [--cohort N]` computes it:

1. contexts with **>= 10 files** (below that there is no structure to challenge -
   the size rule of §1 in SKILL.md, applied harder);
2. **never challenged** first (no snapshot with `strategy: "challenge"`), then the
   oldest challenge;
3. **at most one context per group**, so the cohort spreads over the product and
   two builders in one wave rarely share a seam;
4. among equals, the larger context first - more surface, harder test.

State the cohort and why in the run header. `neverSweep` contexts are skipped.

## 3. The two lenses and the two slots

Every context in the cohort yields **exactly two candidates**, one per slot:

- **Slot A - `architecture-challenger`.** The structural move this context needs
  to stop being the reason something else is hard: the seam that caps it, the
  duplicated rule that should be one module, the synchronous path that should be
  a job, the hand-list that should be derived, the state machine hiding in
  booleans. Supported by reads from `architecture-analyst`, `risk-assessor`,
  `parity-auditor`, `tech-debt-tracker`.
- **Slot B - `ux-elevation`.** The experience leap, not a polish: a flow that
  takes five steps and should take one, a decision the user makes blind that the
  app already has the data for, a surface that reports state it should let you
  act on, a missing mode (compare, bulk, undo, preview). Supported by
  `ux-reviewer`, `state-coverage`, `onboarding-designer`, `visual-craft`.

A context with no user surface (a library, a store module) fills slot B with a
second `architecture-challenger` card on a DIFFERENT seam, and the card says so
(`slot: "B-architecture (no UI surface)"`). An operator-facing UI (an admin page,
a CLI's output) IS a user surface.

**Two cards, not two ideas per lens.** The scout may consider many; it returns its
best two and names the runner-up of each slot in one line, so the critic can see
what was traded away.

**Never re-propose.** Every open backlog of §0, the digest and prior challenge
decks are read first; a card that restates one of their titles is void. A card
MAY adopt an open backlog item that is itself high-effort (an escalated L the
drain left behind) - say so and cite it; that is the best kind of card, because
the premise already survived one reader.

## 4. The card

The §4.10 body (Summary / Description / Flow / Expected impact / Evaluation),
plus these fields, all required:

```json
{"context":"<ctx>","slot":"A|B|B-architecture (no UI surface)","lens":"architecture-challenger|ux-elevation",
 "title":"<= 80 chars","size":"M|L","effort":7,"impact":8,"risk":6,
 "write_set":["<repo-relative path>", "..."],"new_files":["<path>"],
 "shared_surfaces":["messages/en.json"],
 "acceptance":["<behaviour case 1 - input -> expected>", "... 3-8 cases"],
 "premise":"<the file:line facts the idea stands on, as a list>",
 "rollback":"<how it comes out: the commit series reverts cleanly because ...>",
 "gate":"none|contract|policy-tighten|architecture|direction|irreversible|policy-loosen",
 "runner_up":"<the slot's second-best idea, one line>",
 "body":"<the five sections>","evidence":"<proof block>"}
```

- **`acceptance` is the heart of the card.** 3-8 concrete behaviour cases, each an
  input and an expected result, written so a builder can turn each one into a test
  BEFORE touching the implementation. Before = `0 of N pass`, After = `N of N`, the
  `gate` rung of the ladder. A UX card's cases are behaviour of the logic module
  under the surface (the state it enters, the action it enables, the call it makes)
  plus, where the repo can drive a browser, one journey. A card whose claim cannot
  be written as cases is `unmeasurable` and does not reach the deck.
- **`write_set` is a promise.** The builder may shrink it; growing it past the
  declared set by more than the tests and one coupled doc is a demotion (§7).

## 5. The critic - an independent reader grades every card

Idea generation is half of what this mode measures, so the cards are not graded by
the model that wrote them. A **critic** (a separate subagent; the coordinator when
no subagents exist, and the run is then marked `critic: self`) receives the cards
and the tree - **never the scout's reasoning or transcript** - and for each card:

1. **Re-verifies the premise** at every cited `file:line`. A false premise voids
   the card (count it: `premise_false`).
2. **Checks the floors** of §1 and the never-re-propose lists.
3. **Grades** 1-5 on three axes, each with one sentence:
   - **ambition** - is this the move a principal would make here, or a big-sounding
     tidy-up?
   - **grounding** - does every claim stand on the tree as it is?
   - **falsifiability** - would the acceptance cases catch a wrong build?
4. **Verdicts** `build` / `revise` (one concrete change, applied by the
   coordinator, no second scout round) / `void` (with the reason).

The critic never adds a card of its own. `idea_score` for the run is the mean of
the three axes over all cards, void included - a model that writes void cards
should score for them.

## 6. The deck gate - one human decision for the whole run

The deck is the surviving cards, one line each, ranked by `impact x critic mean`,
with size, risk, slot, write-set size and the critic's one-line reason. The
escalations then route like this:

| Gate | In challenge mode |
| --- | --- |
| `none`, `policy-tighten`, `contract` (in-tree, verifier listed) | built if the deck is approved |
| `architecture`, `direction` (inside the manifest's scope) | **the deck approval IS the human decision** - that is the point of this mode; the card must be named on the deck |
| `irreversible`, `policy-loosen`, a contract another repo consumes, `direction` outside the declared scope | **never built here.** Backlogged with the card, and counted on the scorecard as `excluded` |

Attended: present the deck and ask once - build all / a subset / none. `--go` (or
an operator who invoked the run with an explicit instruction to execute) is the
approval in advance, and the report says which it was. Unattended with no `--go`:
stop at the deck, write it as an open backlog (§9 register), do not build.

## 7. Build waves

**Wave planning.** Partition the approved cards into waves of at most `waveSize`
(default 4) builders whose `write_set`s are **disjoint**. `shared_surfaces` (the
overlay lists them: locale catalogs, generated references, ratchet ceilings, tab
registries) do not break disjointness - they are handled by the lock below. A card
whose write set overlaps another's goes to a later wave. A card that changes a
signature other cards call runs ALONE in its wave, first (LESSONS 2.8.0 lighttrack).

**The builder brief** - one subagent per card, and the brief's first lines are:

- the base sha, the branch, and "commit on this branch, never push";
- the card verbatim, including `acceptance` and `write_set`;
- the repo law it will trip (the overlay's `## Challenge mode` block);
- the order: **(1)** re-verify the premise on the current tree - false is a
  `demoted` return, no code; **(2)** write the acceptance cases as tests and watch
  them fail; **(3)** build; **(4)** the tests pass, then every gate the overlay
  names for the touched surface, each asserted by exit code (§7.2 of SKILL.md);
  **(5)** commit as a short series (`test(<ctx>): ...` then `feat|refactor(<ctx>): ...`),
  each commit green;
- the demotion rule: past the write set, past L, or a gate it cannot turn green in
  two attempts -> revert its own uncommitted work and return `demoted` with why;
- the return shape: `{card, status: landed|demoted|partial, shas[], tests_added,
  cases_red_before, cases_green_after, gates:{name: exit}, files_changed,
  lines_changed, deviations_from_card, notes}` - written to the run directory
  BEFORE the agent replies, so a dead agent's work is recoverable.

**Shared checkout.** When builders share one working tree (worktrees cannot run the
repo's gates - the overlay says so), two rules replace isolation:

- **Commit with `git commit -- <paths>`** (only-paths semantics), never a bare
  `git commit` after `git add`: a sibling's staged file must not ride along.
- **The shared-surface lock.** Before editing any `shared_surfaces` file, a builder
  takes the lock with an atomic `mkdir <git-dir>/scan-sweep-challenge.lock`
  (retry every few seconds; stale after 10 minutes), makes the edit, commits it
  IMMEDIATELY and alone, and `rmdir`s the lock. Append at the END of a list, never
  reflow a file (LESSONS 2.8.0: that is what keeps additive hunks unionable).
- A whole-tree gate that goes red on a path the builder did not touch is a
  sibling's in-flight work: re-run it once after a short wait, then report it
  rather than "fixing" a file outside the write set.

With worktrees available (a repo whose gates run in one), give each builder its own
worktree from the base sha and let the coordinator merge; the LESSONS 2.8.0
lighttrack merge rules then apply.

**Integration - after EVERY wave, before the next.** The coordinator runs the
repo's full gate on the combined tree (the builders' green was true for the tree
each one stood in; the combined tree is a different tree). Red on the combined tree:
one fix-forward attempt by the coordinator or a single finisher agent; still red ->
revert that builder's series (`git revert --no-edit <shas>`), mark it `reverted`,
and continue. Never start wave n+1 on a red tree.

## 8. The scorecard - the run measures the model

Append one line per run to `.claude/scan-history/challenge-runs.jsonl`:

```json
{"at":"<ISO>","run":"challenge-<date>","models":{"scout":"<id>","critic":"<id>","builder":"<id>","coordinator":"<id>"},
 "cohort":["<ctx>"],"cards":12,"premise_false":0,"void":1,"revised":2,"approved":10,"excluded":1,
 "idea_score":{"ambition":4.1,"grounding":4.4,"falsifiability":3.9},
 "waves":3,"landed":8,"flawless":6,"demoted":1,"partial":0,"reverted":1,
 "cases":{"written":61,"red_before":61,"green_after":58},
 "integration_failures":2,"coordinator_fixes":1,"lines_changed":5210,
 "tokens":{"scouts":0,"critic":0,"builders":0},"wall_clock_min":0,"note":"<= 120 chars"}
```

- **`flawless`** = landed, every acceptance case red-before and green-after, every
  gate green at hand-off, no coordinator fix at integration, not reverted. It is the
  headline execution number; `landed` without it is a partial credit.
- `execution_score = flawless / approved`, `idea_score` from §5. Report both in the
  run's closing lines, and the delta against the previous `challenge-runs.jsonl`
  row when one exists - the same cohort under a different model is the fairest
  comparison the file can give, and the row says which models ran which role.
- Token and wall-clock figures come from the agents' own usage reports; write `null`
  when a figure was not reported, never an estimate dressed as a count.

Per context, the ordinary §10 snapshot is still written (`strategy: "challenge"`,
`lens_keys: ["architecture-challenger","ux-elevation"]` for the lenses actually
pointed at the context). Challenge lenses do NOT count toward the stabilize
coverage denominator (`coverage.mjs` excludes `Group: challenge`), so a challenge
run cannot make a context look swept.

## 9. What a challenge run is not

- Not a backlog drain: it builds only its own approved cards.
- Not a replacement for the escalations: `irreversible` and `policy-loosen` stay
  out even when the operator says "build everything" - they are asked for by name
  in a separate conversation, not approved in bulk on a deck.
- Not a place to shrink a card to pass. A card that turns out to be an S once read
  properly is re-homed (§1), and the scorecard counts it against `ambition`.
